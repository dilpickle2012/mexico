        <h1>Travel to Cancun</h1>
        <h2 id="hard-rock-heading">Where you should go</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">Cancun is a very interesting place to go to. When I went there, I went to the Hard Rock Hotel. They have two hotels. One for kids/ families, and one for adults. They are about five minutes away from each other. They adult version consists of stores in the hotel that sell expensive jewlery. The kids/families version has a large pool, like a couple hundred sq. ft. It also has a zipline, and a waterslide. They also serve strawberry daiquiries near the pool so you can relax and drink one in the pool. (They have no alcohol). </p>

        <h2 id="chichen-itza-pyramid"> Places to visit and things to see</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">There are also alot of places to visit in Cancun. Cancun features the Mayan Ruins in it. In includes the Chichen Itza which are by far the most popular Mayan Ruins in Mexico. 
        But, it is only a day trip and would be a waste just to go to Cancun for a day. The real place to go to is the El Castillo pyramid which is in Chichen Itza. It is one of the new seven wonders of the world.</p> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Chichen_Itza_3.jpg/1920px-Chichen_Itza_3.jpg" width="317" alt="El Castillo pyramid in Chichen Itza Mayan Ruins">
        <h2>Foods to try</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">There are lots of different foods that you should try in Cancun. There are Tamales, Lime Soups, and Empanadas.<br> <br> A tamale is a traditional Mesoamerican dish, made of masa or dough (starchy, and usually corn-based), which is steamed in a corn leaf or banana leaf. The wrapping can either be discarded prior to eating or used as a plate. Tamales can be filled with meats, cheeses, fruits, vegetables, chilies or any preparation according to taste, and both the filling and the cooking liquid may be seasoned.</p>
